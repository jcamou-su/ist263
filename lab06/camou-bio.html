    My name is Jeronimo Camou and I am an applied data analytics major at Syracuse University. I am very interested in programming as well as using raw data to create something useful.  I love to play basketball, read non-fiction books, and learn new skills and knowledge. I also love watching movies, my favorite one being The Other Guys. I try to get a lot of exercise everyday through basketball, running, or working out. I have an older brother who plays football at school and a younger sister who is currently abroad in France. One funny fact about my life at home is that my dog’s name is the same as one of my best friend’s, Max. Lastly, I am very excited to continue to learn as much as possible when it comes to technology, coding, website development and data analytics so I could use that knowledge to do cool and useful things in the future.
