   <p>
    My name is Jeronimo Camou and I am an applied data analytics major at Syracuse University. I am very interested in programming as well as using raw data to create something useful. 
    One funny fact about my life at home is that my dogs name is the same as one of my best friendâ€™s, Max. Lastly, I am very excited to continue to learn as much as possible when it comes to <strong> technology, coding, website development and data analytics </strong> so I could use that knowledge to do cool and useful things in the future.</p>

I try to get a lot of exercise everyday through basketball, running, or working out. I have an older brother who plays football at school and a younger sister who is currently abroad in France.
